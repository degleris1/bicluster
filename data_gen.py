This module contains the functions to generate random matrices with finite values.
Any discrete distribution is supported by providing a list of possible values and another
list with corresponding cumulative probabilities.
'''

import numpy as np


'''
ACCEPTS a list of choices and a list of associated cumulative probabilities.
RETURNS a randomly selected choice based on the cdf.
RAISES an exception if no entry is selected (likely choices or cdf is incorrect).
'''
def pick_rand(choices, cdf):
    c = np.random.rand()
    for i in range(0, len(cdf)):
        if (c <= cdf[i]):
            return choices[i]
    raise 'Failure picking an element. Check your cdf.'

    
'''
ACCEPTS the matrix height, the matrix width, a list of choices, and a list of
associated cumulative probabilities.
RETURNS a matrix with entries based on the choices and cdf.
'''
def create_matrix(n1, n2, choices, cdf):
    M = np.zeros((n1,n2))
    for r in range(0, n1):
        for c in range(0, n2):
            M[r][c] = pick_rand(choices, cdf)
    return M


'''
ACCEPTS a matrix, the bicluster height, the bicluster width, a list of choices,
# a list of associated cumulative probabilities, the starting row of the cluster,
# and the starting column of the cluster.
# EXECUTION adds a new cluster to the matrix (modifiying input).
# RETURNS the updated matrix.
# RAISES an exception if cluster won't fit.
